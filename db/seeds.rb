# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

# Person.create! ([
#   {name: "ron", bio: "lives in the woods"},
#   {name: "betty", bio: "workin for the weekend"},
#   {name: "babs", bio: "tough cookie waitress at the diner"}])
